> A curated, source-backed list of projects built with Jev, TypeSafe AI's System One model for fast, typed, probabilistic decisions.

Jev takes program state plus typed questions and returns constrained answers with probabilities. It is designed for software decisions such as classification, routing, scoring, ranking, verification, and guardrails, rather than free-form text generation.

This list favors public source code, concrete Jev usage, clear limitations, and reproducible evidence. The latest review added **20 source-reviewed integrations, projects, and studies**, bringing the community catalog to **155**, alongside official resources, provider integrations, and related lists. See the [September 20 research notes](research/2026-09-20.md) for pinned source evidence and review boundaries. Review completed September 20, 2026 (Europe/Istanbul); upstream event dates below are UTC.

## Start here

**System One shape:** text or structured state + typed questions → constrained answers + probabilities → deterministic application code.

**Question primitives:** `Choice` selects an option, `Score` evaluates ordered rubric levels, and `Noul` returns a number from 0 to 1 representing the probability of "yes". Review or abstention behavior is defined in application code. See the [primitive reference](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives).

**Input boundary:** the hosted Jev model is text-only. Browser, audio, image, and robotics projects supply extracted text or structured observations, or use separate perception models. Independent multimodal reproductions are listed separately.

**Good fits:** semantic routing, triage, reranking, rubric scoring, moderation, verification, and low-latency decisions inside bounded workflows.

**Important caveat:** schema-valid output is not the same as a correct decision. Validate on your own data, calibrate thresholds, keep high-impact actions behind deterministic checks, and provide a human fallback.

## Recent developments

**September 18: Python SDK 0.7.0.** [Release notes](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-python/releases/tag/v0.7.0) document a breaking serialization change from `msgspec` to Pydantic, a new `response_model` argument, and corrected serialization of `str` subclasses.

**September 18: OpenRouter listing.** Jev 1.13 is listed with a September 18 date. This is a provider listing date, not evidence of a separate new upstream model revision.

**September 16: Vercel AI Gateway integration.** The integration introduces typed evaluation via AI SDK's experimental `evaluate` API.

**Current model:** TypeSafe documents `jev-1.13.0`, with both `jev-latest` and `jev-preview` currently pointing to it. Pin the version when comparing evaluations.

**September 20: framework adoption.** Source-level Jev integrations are now present in LangChain, Pydantic AI, LiteLLM, Rig, Composio, Effect, BAML, Ax, and TanStack AI. Availability and release status vary, so inspect the linked repository before depending on a package.

## SDKs and developer tools

Community-maintained clients and tools; official TypeSafe SDKs are listed above.

- [advocaat](https://github.com/pithings/advocaat) - Small type-safe client for asking Jev questions about datasets.
- [discern](https://github.com/doeixd/discern) - TypeScript library for Effect: Jev's Choice, Noul, and Score answers become typed patterns with an explicit `Uncertain` branch, and procedure routing, with recording, replay, caching, and call budgets as `DecisionModel` middleware.
- [hunch (carldaws)](https://github.com/carldaws/hunch) - Probabilistic control flow for Ruby: `if Hunch.likely?("fraudulent", given: order)` branches on a typed Jev answer, with graded predicates from `possibly?` to `almost_certainly?`; a [TypeScript port](https://github.com/carldaws/hunch-ts) offers the same interface.
- [hunch (steven-shoemaker)](https://github.com/steven-shoemaker/hunch) - Python library that asks Jev closed-set questions over each item in a list or DataFrame (classify, score, rank, check, where, extract, pick, verify), caches the answers, and joins them back, while code owns candidates, thresholds, and actions; a [TypeScript port](https://github.com/steven-shoemaker/hunch-js) offers the same verbs.
- [jeff](https://github.com/saembit/jeff-cli) - Go CLI where Jev scores each item on each weighted dimension of a YAML spec in one request and code sums the weights into a ranking, with noul, choice and score commands whose thresholds become exit codes for shell and CI.
- [jegrep](https://github.com/can1357/jegrep) - Rust semantic grep that scores live repository files and ranges with Jev probabilities, without an embedding index or background daemon.

- [jev-mcp](https://github.com/BYK/jev-mcp) - An eval-first MCP server for Jev, that returns typed judgments (noul, choice, score) with probabilities instead of generated text.
- [jev-shell-history](https://github.com/mrnugget/jev-shell-history) - Ranks existing zsh history entries for inline completion; accepting a suggestion does not execute it.
- [jev.nvim](https://github.com/valentynkit/jev.nvim) - Neovim plugin that splits the buffer into functions with Treesitter, scores each against a plain-language question with Jev, and ranks answers by probability in the quickfix window.

- [zod-jev](https://github.com/jomatsu/zod-jev) - Pairs local Zod shape validation with Jev semantic validation.

## Agents, coding, and guardrails

Source-reviewed experiments and integrations. A model judgment does not establish safety or replace the host application's permission checks.

- [agent-router](https://github.com/nidhi-singh02/agent-router) - Pre-release Herdr integration that filters eligible coding models by quota and policy before Jev ranks them.
- [blink](https://github.com/ellipsis-dev/blink) - Navigates file and directory names with Jev-guided walkers to find codebase paths for a natural-language query.

- [Codex Jev Router](https://github.com/suenot/codex-jev-router) - Uses Jev Choice and Noul decisions to select a Codex subagent model and reasoning effort; uncertain decisions fall back to Sol.
- [commit-miner](https://github.com/devanshbatham/commit-miner) - Classifies Git diffs and commit messages into change types and candidate security-fix/CWE labels for inspection.
- [Edward](https://github.com/VeridicalTech/Edward) - External control plane for coding agents: one batched Jev call judges the whole cross-turn trajectory (continue, pause, or escalate, confidence-gated), while deterministic code owns dangerous-command blocking, budget caps, intervention execution, and an Ed25519-signed receipt chain.
- [foreman](https://github.com/thruwire/foreman) - Software-factory supervisor that uses Jev to keep coding agents on task.
- [is-malicious](https://github.com/luantak/is-malicious) - Scans source, configuration, build, and CI files with Jev, then reports suspicious behavior and implicated lines before the code is run.
- [jev-agent-skill](https://github.com/yuyang2230/jev-agent-skill) - Claude Code/ZCode skill that offloads classify, screen, score, and compliance-check judgments to Jev via OpenCode Zen's free tier; ships a retry-hardened zero-dependency caller and a shop comment-triage pipeline.
- [Jev Auto Router](https://github.com/miniLV/Jev-Auto-Router) - Prototype per-call router for Codex: a Jev Choice picks the model and reasoning effort for each call, a local Responses proxy continues the tool loop, and an independent verification step audits the result; no cost-savings claims.
- [jev-belay](https://github.com/valentynkit/jev-belay) - Claude Code Stop hook that checks the transcript for evidence before trusting a "done" claim, spending one four-question Jev call only when files changed with no passing check since, and failing open on every error path.
- [jev-codex-router](https://github.com/0xNatoshi/jev-codex-router) - Per-turn Codex model, reasoning, and speed-mode routing.
- [jev-commit](https://github.com/valentynkit/jev-commit) - Pre-commit hook where one Jev call judges whether the commit message matches the staged diff, flags debug leftovers and unmentioned work, and blocks only when it detects a credential.
- [jev-engineering](https://github.com/eugeniughelbur/jev-engineering) - Decision layer for coding agents: deterministic hard rules, then a Jev call, exposed as a Claude Code PreToolUse hook, an MCP server, a loopback service and a shared team policy. Ships a 300-call injection kit and its results: blunt injections moved 0 of 30 dangerous commands but caused 10% false denials on safe ones, authority framing moved 3 of 30.
- [jev-guard (leepokai)](https://github.com/leepokai/jev-guard) - Cross-agent tool-call risk scoring with allow, ask, and deny outcomes.
- [jevguard-mcp](https://github.com/seb4ez/jevguard-mcp) - Zero-dependency MCP server and Python runtime where Jev evaluates shell command safety, code patch regression risk, and discrete decision certainty, with local SQLite WAL caching and automatic closed-world escape injection.

- [JevRouter](https://github.com/BillionsBobby/JevRouter) - Routes agent requests across models, subagents, skills, MCP tools, CLIs, and plugins with Jev Choice decisions; the host filters by availability, permissions, risk, and confirmation before anything executes.
- [jev-scout](https://github.com/kierandotai/jev-scout) - MCP server that scores an agent's every search query, result, and fetched page for relevance and credibility, with session budgets, SSRF-guarded fetching, and a live decision dashboard.
- [jev-skill-router](https://github.com/shimo4228/jev-skill-router) - Claude Code plugin whose UserPromptSubmit hook asks Jev one `Choice` over the installed skill roster plus `Noul` gates, while code applies the thresholds and names at most one skill; it starts in a shadow mode that only logs the decision.
- [jev-use](https://github.com/shitianfang/jev-use) - Claude Code / Codex / pi plugin where Jev answers batched noul, choice, and score questions and risk-checks tool calls, while a typed escalation contract hands writing and unsure steps back to the LLM.
- [JevLoop](https://github.com/parkavenue9639/jevloop) - Python agent runtime where Jev `Choice` decisions select tools and targets, uncertain decisions escalate to an LLM, and a shared guarded kernel supports isolated Docker workspaces and paired LLM-only comparisons.
- [jevwire](https://github.com/Brainwires/jevwire) - MCP tools, an embeddable decision library, and advisory or restrictive Claude Code hooks; judgments do not grant native permissions.
- [Jevonian](https://github.com/xinyao27/jevonian) - Local OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible proxy where one Jev call answers model route and thinking level for `jevonian/auto`, after deterministic code has already filtered candidates by wire protocol, context window, thinking-level floor, and spent quota windows; `minConfidence` marks a low-confidence route in the ledger instead of silently accepting it, and Jev is skipped entirely for pinned models, explicit `jevonian/<route>` requests, and `routing.mode: "off"`.
- [langchain-skill-router](https://github.com/deyna256/langchain-skill-router) - Per-turn skill routing for LangChain deepagents: Jev ranks the SKILL.md catalog against the request and the recent conversation and verifies the top candidates, while the library applies the thresholds and either loads one skill's instructions or offers a short list; the judge is a protocol, so a self-hosted model or static rules can take Jev's place.
- [Oko](https://github.com/bartlomein/oko) - Jev judges whether each keyword-shortlisted code chunk implements what a coding agent asked for; code applies the threshold and returns the accepted chunks as excerpts over MCP.
- [opencode-jev-orchestrator](https://github.com/aaronshaf/opencode-jev-orchestrator) - Keeps an OpenCode parent model fixed and uses Jev difficulty judgments to delegate harder turns to temporary subagents.
- [perch](https://github.com/lakeday-org/perch) - Semantic code linter that evaluates code units against configurable Jev questions.
- [pi-jev](https://github.com/y0usaf/pi-jev) - Measured tool-call gate and general typed decision layer for the Pi coding agent.
- [pi-warden](https://github.com/DevMortimer/pi-warden) - Pi extension that judges rule compliance, risky actions, stuck loops, and completion claims; enforcement depends on the hook and policy.
- [skillbox](https://github.com/kitze/skillbox) - Self-hosted skill library with optional Jev relevance recommendations over an authorized catalog.
- [skillranker](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/skillranker) - Rust CLI that ranks agent skills against live session context and can abstain.
- [slop-grader](https://github.com/lukstei/slop-grader) - Rule-based text grader that uses Jev scores and line-by-line flags to audit documents against custom rulesets and guide an AI agent to auto-fix violations.
- [supercov](https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supercov) - Scores source files so coding agents can prioritize code-quality work.
- [Switchboard](https://github.com/ruban-24/switchboard) - Claude Code and Codex wrapper that uses Jev to assess a new conversation's task, applies deterministic confidence rules to choose a model and reasoning effort, and pins the pair through follow-ups, tool calls, and resume to avoid unnecessary prompt-cache disruption.
- [taste-lint](https://github.com/mblode/taste-lint) - CLI that uses Jev probabilities on semantic taste checks to catch AI slop in UI, copy, and agent instructions before ship.
- [wakegate](https://github.com/shitianfang/wakegate) - Experimental gate where Jev decides whether a timer or incoming event is worth resuming a sleeping agent's LLM; code skips only when Jev is confident and always wakes on user messages, errors, and a skip limit.

## Context and compaction

These tools select what reaches a model. Preserving retained text verbatim does not prove that omitted history was unnecessary.

- [fast-dev-compaction](https://github.com/leonaaardob/fast-dev-compaction) - Codex port that restores Jev-selected verbatim history around native session compaction.
- [fast-jev-compaction](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction) - Claude Code plugin and library that score tool-call/result pairs for deletion or truncation while retaining selected text verbatim.
- [pi-fast-jev-compaction](https://github.com/joelhooks/pi-fast-jev-compaction) - Pi extension that prunes stale tool history and leaves summary compaction to Pi when pruning is insufficient.
- [pi-jev-compact](https://github.com/ilkerulusoy/pi-jev-compact) - Selective, verbatim context compaction for Pi using Jev model.
- [pi-jev-context](https://github.com/kevinpita/pi-jev-context) - Opt-in Pi extension that filters older messages from model requests while preserving the original session history.
- [winnow](https://github.com/GhalebDweikat/winnow) - Judges tool results before admitting them into Claude Code context.
- [yoshi](https://github.com/compozy/yoshi) - Experimental Claude Code/Codex proxy that uses Jev to prune request context while preserving tool-call protocol structure.

## Browser and computer use

These projects can operate real browsers or devices when enabled. Published demos have task-specific success criteria and do not establish general reliability.

- [BrowserClaw](https://github.com/GoldenLoaf24h/browserclaw) - Zero-lock, session-preserving Chrome MCP server that couples a local Jev System One semantic micro-loop (`chrome_act_toward_goal`) with an 85%+ pruned DOM tree (Shadow DOM & iframe pierced), dispatching native CDP events (`isTrusted: true`) on active logged-in sessions without focus theft.
- [jev-browser](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-browser) - Browser-use experiment powered by Jev decisions.
- [jev-browser-use](https://github.com/wy-coliney/jev-browser-use) - Codex browser skill that uses Jev for navigation and target selection while Codex handles text entry and outcome verification.
- [jev-social](https://github.com/socai-io/jev-social) - Local Instagram and TikTok research app where Jev selects a platform and bounded socai operation from observed state, while code enforces confidence and the socai CLI executes the browser step.
- [jev-ultrafast](https://github.com/browser-use/jev-ultrafast) - Browser agent where Jev selects an operation and compatible DOM target, and a separate LLM supplies typed text.
- [jev-voice-browser](https://github.com/moritzkremb/jev-voice-browser) - Maps partial speech transcripts to browser intents and observed targets, with code deciding whether to act, wait, or ask.
- [Jev for Chrome](https://github.com/chy4pro/jev-for-chrome) - Unofficial Chrome extension (Manifest V3) port of Jev Ultrafast: Jev picks the operation and DOM element in one request, a small text model writes typed values, and it runs in the user's own tabs through OpenRouter, TypeSafe or Cloudflare; includes a 17-task headless-Chromium suite with recorded traces.
- [mobile-jev](https://github.com/droidrun/mobile-jev) - Android agent using Mobilerun observations and bounded Jev actions; execute mode controls a real device, while the published Uber demo stops before booking.
- [typesafe-computer-use](https://github.com/awlevin/typesafe-computer-use) - macOS computer-use experiment using OCR plus bounded Jev action selection.

## Routing, data, and workflows

- [algovault-integrations: typesafe-jev](https://github.com/AlgoVaultLabs/algovault-integrations/tree/main/examples/typesafe-jev) - Jev decides whether to act on a composite AlgoVault verdict (direction, confidence, regime) for a crypto perp market now, and how well the regime fits a directional entry; code computes position conflict, applies every threshold, and logs act, hold, or escalate. Read-only: it never places orders, and runs as a dry run with no key required.
- [duckdb-jev](https://github.com/colliber/duckdb-jev) - DuckDB extension that exposes Jev judgments as SQL values with return types derived from the declared criteria.
- [HA-Jev](https://github.com/AboveColin/HA-Jev) - Home Assistant integration exposing typed answers as sensors, automation actions, and an Assist conversation agent.

- [jev-align (Sutro)](https://github.com/sutro-sh/jev-align) - Active-learning CLI where Jev evaluates rows and surfaces uncertain or audit samples for human labeling, then GEPA proposes revised decision definitions that the user can accept or reject.
- [jev-curate](https://github.com/AkashPriyadarshii/jev-curate) - Streaming filter and scorer for Parquet and JSONL datasets.
- [jev-guard (klauswg)](https://github.com/klauswg/jev-guard) - Real-time deposit/withdrawal risk-triage gateway for crypto exchanges: Jev answers four typed questions per transfer while a hard-rule layer vetoes and a direction-aware Java gate composes the final action; ships a 100-sample, three-column calibration (rules-only vs Jev vs combined) with stated limitations.
- [jev-logtriage](https://github.com/jyatesdotdev/jev-logtriage) - Jev scores collapsed log batches for noise, severity, and whether an operator should act. Code maps the answers to suppress, watch, review, notify, or page. Nothing is executed.
- [JevMail](https://github.com/fazlerocks/jevmail) - Read-only Gmail triage that stores messages locally and asks Jev for bounded category, urgency, and human-sender probabilities.
